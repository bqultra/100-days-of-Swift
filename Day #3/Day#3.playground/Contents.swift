//Arithmetic operators

//When we want to divide number equally to another we can use this:
let number = 465
let isMultiple = number.isMultiple(of: 7)


//Operator overloading - joining data with the same type

//Shorthand operators (compound assignment) - we can chane variable fast in place

//Comparision operators - we can compare data
let firstScored = 6
let secondScored = 4

firstScored == secondScored //equal
firstScored != secondScored //not equal

firstScored < secondScored //less than
firstScored >= secondScored //greater or equal than

//We can even create comparable enums

//This will print "true" because small comes before large in the case list


//Conditions - if statement
let firstCard = 11

if firstCard + secondCard == 21 {
    
    print("Aces â€“ lucky!") //it will run when condition is true

if age1 > 18 || age2 > 18 { // || means "or" so there is a result when one of the conditions are true
    print("At least one is over 18")

//TIP: It's better to add parentheses for better understanding our conditions mix


//Ternary operator - it's rarely used; It check condition and when it's true it returns second value or third when it's a false
let firstCards = 11

//Switch statements - if we have several conditions we can use switch with cases rather than if and else if

    fallthrough //Swift runs code inside case but we can use fallthrough to continue on to the next case
default:
    print("Enjoy your day!") //if there is no case met Swift prints declared default value
}


//Range operators - they let us create ranges
let scores = 85

switch score {
case 0..<50: //..< - this operator create range but exclude the final value (which here is 50); ... - this includes final value
    print("You failed badly.")

let names = ["Piper", "Alex", "Suzanne", "Gloria"]

//With values we can print a range of values
print(names[1...3]) //it will fail when index doesn't have enough values in it
print(names[1...]) //this wil take values from 1 to the end of an array

// ..< - excluding final value
// ... - including final value
